Trying to learn a little Haskell with some experiments.

### TODO
- [x] try to implement simple zipper (list zipper, ntree zipper, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipper_(data_structure))
- [ ] learn comonad. Try to implement some simple Game of Life
- [ ] learn state monad with some simple example
- [ ] learn free monad with some simple example

### Run
Install Haskell (https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/)

Within eg. `zipper` folder run:

```
runhaskell mainNTreeZipper.hs
```

or

```
runhaskell mainListZipper.hs
```
